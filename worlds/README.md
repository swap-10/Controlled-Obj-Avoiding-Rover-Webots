The HTML, X3D and json files are auto-generated by the HTML-5 animation generating feature in webots<br>
I've made these available here so that it's easier to have an idea about the proj and what its like by downloading a few files.<br>
There are some setup steps before the animations can be run on your local machine<br>
These are documented at the Cyberbotics Webots docs here: https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-scene#remarks-on-the-used-technologies-and-their-limitations
